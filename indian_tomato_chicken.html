    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken pieces coated with many fragrant spices like turmeric, cardamom and cloves, then simmered in a tomato sauce. This dish is a family favorite. I have also taken it to potlucks and served it to guests in my home. Everyone asks for the recipe. It is a great slow cooker meal, too. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large onion, chopped </li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped </li>
      <li>1 slice fresh ginger root </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom </li>
      <li>1 (1 inch) piece cinnamon stick </li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves </li>
      <li>2 bay leaves </li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg </li>
      <li>6 skinless chicken thighs </li>
      <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, crushed </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Place onion, garlic and ginger in a food processor and process into a paste. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat, add onion paste and saute, stirring continuously, for about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir in the cumin, turmeric, salt, pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves and nutmeg. Saute, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes. Place chicken pieces in skillet and stir them around with the spice mixture until they are well coated.</li>
      <li>Saute for another 4 minutes, then pour in the tomatoes with liquid and stir. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 to 2 hours, or until the oil has separated from the liquid. Stir occasionally. (Note: If you simmer uncovered, the sauce will thicken; add water, or keep covered while simmering.)</li>
    </ol>
